# DSD Lab

This repository contains a compilation of lab programs completed during the third semester in the DSD (Digital System Design) Lab.

## Warning
Due to a highly *competent* lab instructor, this lab did NOT follow the lab manual and was very different from what other sections were doing. As a result, the programs listed here may not match the programs outlined in the lab manual. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for lab exercises undertaken during the third semester. It's intended to provide insights into problem-solving approaches and solutions implemented during the lab sessions.

## Notes
- The solutions presented here may not represent the most optimal or cleanest implementations. There is always room for improvement, and better solutions may exist.
